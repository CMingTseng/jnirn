JNI Register Natives
====================

A tool to generate calls to RegisterNatives for JNI code on platforms
that do not support dynamic loading of native code.

Also supports native registration of ProGuard processed files - so you can obfuscate both native methods, 
and java that is called-back from native C code.

Work in progress...
