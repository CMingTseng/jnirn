JNI Register Natives
====================

A tool to generate calls to RegisterNatives for JNI code on platforms that do not support dynamic loading of native code.

Also supports native registration of code that has been processed by [ProGuard] - so you can obfuscate both native methods, and java that is called-back from native C code.
